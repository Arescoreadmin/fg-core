This allows for Privilege Escalation or arbitrary code execution by modifying now-writable scripts.    ### Recommended Fix   The unpack function must not use zinfo.filename for post-extraction operations. It should use the sanitized path returned by wf.extract().    ### Suggested Patch:   ``` # extract() returns the actual path where the file was written extracted_path = wf.extract(zinfo, destination)  # Only apply chmod if a file was actually written if extracted_path:     permissions = zinfo.external_attr >> 16 & 0o777     Path(extracted_path).chmod(permissions) ```"}]}, {"name": "xmltodict", "version": "0.13.0", "vulns": []}, {"name": "yq", "version": "3.1.0", "vulns": []}], "fixes": []}
