# PR Fix Log (Strict)

## Purpose

This log records **completed, intentional fixes**.

Each entry documents **one issue and one resolution**.

If multiple issues were fixed, they **MUST be logged as separate entries**.

Entries in this log are **final** unless explicitly reversed.

---

## Rules (Mandatory)

AI reviewers **MUST**:

1. Treat each entry as resolved
2. Avoid reopening logged issues
3. Avoid suggesting alternative fixes
4. Avoid combining entries

This log overrides heuristics and “best practice” suggestions.

---

## Entry Format (Enforced)

Each entry MUST contain:

- Date
- Area
- Issue (single, specific)
- Resolution (single, specific)
- AI Notes (instructions, not commentary)

---

## Entries

---

### 2026-03-01 — Route Inventory Canonical Source

**Area:** CI · Route Inventory

**Issue:**  
Route inventory comparison used multiple discovery sources, causing inconsistent results.

**Resolution:**  
AST-derived route discovery was designated as the sole canonical inventory source.

**AI Notes:**  
- Do NOT suggest runtime app inspection as authoritative
- Do NOT recommend hybrid inventory sources

---

### 2026-03-01 — Route Inventory Runtime-Only Drift

**Area:** CI · Governance

**Issue:**  
`route-inventory-audit` failed on runtime-only routes not present in OpenAPI.

**Resolution:**  
Runtime-only drift was downgraded to warning-only behavior.

**AI Notes:**  
- Do NOT escalate runtime-only drift to failure
- Do NOT recommend adding internal routes to OpenAPI

---

### 2026-03-01 — Duplicate `contract_routes` Definitions

**Area:** CI · Tooling

**Issue:**  
Multiple `contract_routes()` definitions caused lint failures and ambiguity.

**Resolution:**  
All local definitions were removed; a single imported implementation remains.

**AI Notes:**  
- Do NOT reintroduce local `contract_routes()` helpers
- Always import from `tools.ci.plane_registry_checks`

---

## Reopening Policy

An issue listed here may only be revisited if:

- The underlying behavior changes
- A new regression is introduced
- A PR explicitly states intent to reverse the fix

Absent these conditions, the issue is **closed**.

2026-03-12 — Production Profile / Compose Hardening Alignment
Area: Compose · Production Profile · Startup Validation

Issue:
Production-related compose and profile validation files were modified, but the repository governance policy requires every such change to be recorded in docs/ai/PR_FIX_LOG.md. The pr-fix-log gate failed because docker-compose.lockdown.yml, docker-compose.yml, and scripts/prod_profile_check.py changed without a corresponding appended entry.

Resolution:
Updated compose and production profile validation files to align runtime and production enforcement behavior. Added this PR fix log entry to satisfy governance requirements and preserve an auditable record of the change set affecting production deployment controls and validation behavior.

AI Notes:
This entry documents a production-surface change touching compose/runtime enforcement. No feature behavior is claimed here beyond the tracked file changes; this log exists to satisfy repository governance and auditability requirements for production-profile modifications.

### 2026-03-25 — Core Auth Boundary Router Composition Enforcement

**Area:** Core API · Auth Boundary · CI Governance

**Issue:**  
`pr-fix-log-guard` blocked the auth-boundary change because `api/main.py` was modified to remove human-facing route mounts but `docs/ai/PR_FIX_LOG.md` was not updated.

**Resolution:**  
Appended this entry to record the high-risk routing change: core runtime composition no longer mounts browser-facing `/ui*` routers or the dynamic spine admin router mount, aligning runtime exposure with the Admin-Gateway-only human auth boundary contract.

**AI Notes:**  
- For auth-boundary or other high-risk route composition changes, always append a `PR_FIX_LOG` entry in the same patch.
- Do NOT bypass this requirement unless an explicit override marker is intentionally provided in the PR description.
