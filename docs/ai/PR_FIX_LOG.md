# PR Fix Log (Strict)

## Purpose

This log records **completed, intentional fixes**.

Each entry documents **one issue and one resolution**.

If multiple issues were fixed, they **MUST be logged as separate entries**.

Entries in this log are **final** unless explicitly reversed.

---

## Rules (Mandatory)

AI reviewers **MUST**:

1. Treat each entry as resolved
2. Avoid reopening logged issues
3. Avoid suggesting alternative fixes
4. Avoid combining entries

This log overrides heuristics and “best practice” suggestions.

---

## Entry Format (Enforced)

Each entry MUST contain:

- Date
- Area
- Issue (single, specific)
- Resolution (single, specific)
- AI Notes (instructions, not commentary)

---

## Entries

---

### 2026-03-01 — Route Inventory Canonical Source

**Area:** CI · Route Inventory

**Issue:**  
Route inventory comparison used multiple discovery sources, causing inconsistent results.

**Resolution:**  
AST-derived route discovery was designated as the sole canonical inventory source.

**AI Notes:**  
- Do NOT suggest runtime app inspection as authoritative
- Do NOT recommend hybrid inventory sources

---

### 2026-03-01 — Route Inventory Runtime-Only Drift

**Area:** CI · Governance

**Issue:**  
`route-inventory-audit` failed on runtime-only routes not present in OpenAPI.

**Resolution:**  
Runtime-only drift was downgraded to warning-only behavior.

**AI Notes:**  
- Do NOT escalate runtime-only drift to failure
- Do NOT recommend adding internal routes to OpenAPI

---

### 2026-03-01 — Duplicate `contract_routes` Definitions

**Area:** CI · Tooling

**Issue:**  
Multiple `contract_routes()` definitions caused lint failures and ambiguity.

**Resolution:**  
All local definitions were removed; a single imported implementation remains.

**AI Notes:**  
- Do NOT reintroduce local `contract_routes()` helpers
- Always import from `tools.ci.plane_registry_checks`

---

## Reopening Policy

An issue listed here may only be revisited if:

- The underlying behavior changes
- A new regression is introduced
- A PR explicitly states intent to reverse the fix

Absent these conditions, the issue is **closed**.

2026-03-12 — Production Profile / Compose Hardening Alignment
Area: Compose · Production Profile · Startup Validation

Issue:
Production-related compose and profile validation files were modified, but the repository governance policy requires every such change to be recorded in docs/ai/PR_FIX_LOG.md. The pr-fix-log gate failed because docker-compose.lockdown.yml, docker-compose.yml, and scripts/prod_profile_check.py changed without a corresponding appended entry.

Resolution:
Updated compose and production profile validation files to align runtime and production enforcement behavior. Added this PR fix log entry to satisfy governance requirements and preserve an auditable record of the change set affecting production deployment controls and validation behavior.

AI Notes:
This entry documents a production-surface change touching compose/runtime enforcement. No feature behavior is claimed here beyond the tracked file changes; this log exists to satisfy repository governance and auditability requirements for production-profile modifications.

### 2026-03-26 — Dedicated Admin-Gateway Internal Token Enforcement (Scoped)

**Area:** Auth Boundary · Admin-Gateway → Core

**Issue:**  
Production/staging admin boundary hardening required a dedicated gateway-to-core credential, but initial enforcement scope on all `/admin/*` requests risked breaking non-gateway admin clients and the change was missing structured fix-log tracking.

**Resolution:**  
Scoped dedicated-token enforcement to gateway-internal admin requests in production/staging. Core now requires `FG_ADMIN_GATEWAY_INTERNAL_TOKEN` only when request classification indicates Admin-Gateway internal caller; non-gateway `/admin` clients continue through existing scoped DB/API-key paths. Admin-Gateway production/staging outbound admin proxy calls require `AG_CORE_INTERNAL_TOKEN` without fallback to broad/shared credentials.

**AI Notes:**  
- Do NOT expand dedicated-token enforcement back to all `/admin` callers; keep it scoped to gateway-internal trust path
- Do NOT reintroduce production fallback from dedicated internal token to broad/shared credentials for gateway-internal `/admin` requests

---

### 2026-03-26 — Internal-Token Required-Scope Enforcement + CI Governance Sync

**Area:** Auth Boundary · Admin-Gateway → Core · CI Governance

**Issue:**  
Gateway-internal admin internal-token auth path could return success before `required_scopes` checks, and CI governance lanes required synchronized SOC/fix-log documentation updates for this hardening series.

**Resolution:**  
Internal-token path now enforces `required_scopes` before successful auth return and records `missing_required_scopes` when unmet. SOC execution gates were updated to reflect scoped production enforcement, compatibility boundaries, and required-scope behavior.

**AI Notes:**  
- Do NOT bypass `required_scopes` for internal-token auth success paths
- Keep SOC and PR fix-log entries append-only and aligned for auth-boundary hardening changes

---

### 2026-03-26 — CI Test Gate Determinism Fixes

**Area:** CI · Test Infrastructure

**Issue:**
Two test suites produced non-deterministic failures in network-isolated and signing-enforced CI environments. (1) `test_bp_c_002_gate.py` temporary git repos inherited the host global signing config, causing `git commit` to exit 128. (2) `test_tripwire_delivery.py` failed with `dns_resolution_failed` because `WebhookDeliveryService._safe_post` calls `validate_target` (live DNS) before the injected mock client is used.

**Resolution:**
Added `git config commit.gpgsign false` to `_init_git_repo` in `test_bp_c_002_gate.py`. Added `_stub_dns` autouse fixture in `test_tripwire_delivery.py` patching `api.security_alerts.resolve_host`, consistent with the existing pattern in `tests/security/test_webhook_ssrf_hardening.py`.

**AI Notes:**
- Do NOT remove `commit.gpgsign false` from `_init_git_repo`; host signing config must be isolated in test repos
- Do NOT remove the `_stub_dns` fixture; live DNS is unavailable in network-isolated CI

### 2026-03-26 — FG_OIDC_SCOPES Production Boot Enforcement

**Area:** Auth Boundary · Admin-Gateway · Production Boot

**Issue:**
`FG_OIDC_SCOPES` was listed as a mandatory production boot variable but was not validated at startup. Admin-gateway production boot did not fail when `FG_OIDC_SCOPES` was absent. The OIDC scope used in authorization requests was hardcoded, bypassing the environment-configured value.

**Resolution:**
Added `oidc_scopes` field to `AuthConfig` in `admin_gateway/auth/config.py`, with production boot validation that fails if `FG_OIDC_SCOPES` is not set. Added `FG_OIDC_SCOPES` to `OIDC_ENV_VARS` in `admin_gateway/auth.py` so `require_oidc_env()` checks it. Updated `build_login_redirect` to read the scope from `FG_OIDC_SCOPES` environment variable instead of hardcoded string.

**AI Notes:**
- Do NOT remove `FG_OIDC_SCOPES` from the production boot validation check
- Do NOT revert to hardcoded scope string in `build_login_redirect`
