# FrostGate Execution State

This is the single canonical execution state for the frozen Launch Readiness Audit.
Update current status fields in place. Preserve historical entries under `Execution History`.

## Current Status

**Date:** 2026-07-30

**Current Branch:** `main`

**Current PR:** None — main is clean. T1.5 (#598) merged. Ring_state_dir fix (#595) merged.

**Overall Status:** YELLOW

**Launch Confidence (%):** 68

**Current Critical Path:** T2/T3 top-5 secret rotation -> T4 portal named-user production proof -> T5 infrastructure headroom -> T6 full H1-H18 production dry run with CG v0 drift rehearsal.

**Current Phase:** Stage 0 / Week 1 Day 1 — T1 + T1.5 complete, advancing to T2/T3.

**Current DoD Progress:** 1/14 Launch DoD items checked with post-freeze durable evidence (L4: PASS, now with automation + monthly-drill infrastructure on top).

**Completed Since Last Update:** T1.5 merged to main via PR #598 (5f5d4a17). Final script has 10 subcommands (backup/verify/verify-manifest/restore/list/prune/drill/inventory/metrics/status). Signed manifests (HMAC-SHA256), immutable backup IDs (FG-BKP-YYYYMMDD-NNNNN from max existing sequence), dry-run mode on all destructive actions, backup health dashboard (artifacts/operations/backup_health.json), Prometheus metrics text output. Six bot review findings corrected: retention bucketing by age range (not global count), offsite_uploaded truth on 3-state provider exit, restore validates against manifest source_row_counts not live prod, manifest uploaded after verification, encrypted archive discovery via find with .dump.enc glob, backup ID sequence from manifest scan. 73 hermetic pytest tests, CI green. Dockerfile fix (#595) creates /app/state and /app/models — ring_state_dir crash resolved in image; Railway env var FG_RING_STATE_DIR should be changed to /var/lib/frostgate/state if not already done.

**Current Blockers:**
- FG-LR-001: no verified end-to-end production dry run on the current identity/provisioning stack.
- FG-LR-002: portal named-user invite -> OIDC -> session -> logout revocation unproven with a real external identity in production.
- FG-LR-004: Railway plan/headroom and orphan recovery are unproven under engagement load. Note: Railway hobby plan confirmed; T5 will determine if upgrade to Pro is needed for automatic backups and headroom.
- FG-LR-005: incident/rollback runbook and timed drill are missing.
- **Operational (if not yet resolved):** Change Railway `FG_RING_STATE_DIR` from `/app/state` to `/var/lib/frostgate/state` to prevent API crash on next deploy.

**Top Three Priorities:**
1. Execute T2: enable Anthropic auto-recharge and confirm Anthropic balance.
2. Execute T3: rotate top-5 blast-radius secrets before the dry run validates final config (S-1 invariant).
3. Execute T4: prove the real external portal named-user path in production and collect session/revocation evidence.

**Next Required PR:** T2/T3 (auto-recharge + secret rotation) are 0.6 days combined. T4 portal named-user proof is 2 days. Branch from main; each task gets its own PR.

**Estimated Engineering Days Remaining:** 16.5 (budget 19.0; T1 consumed 1.5d, T1.5 consumed ~1.0d).

**Estimated Launch Date:** 2026-08-27, contingent on all Launch DoD L1-L14 passing.

**T1 Result:**

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| T1 status | COMPLETE |
| L4 status | PASS |
| FG-LR-003 status | CLOSED |
| Railway plan tier | hobby |
| Automatic Railway backups | None (hobby plan: `maxBackupsCount = 0`) |
| Backup mechanism | Manual `pg_dump` via Docker (`pgvector/pgvector:pg18`) |
| Production DB | PostgreSQL 18.4, migration 0168, 372 tables, 7 engagements |
| Dump size | 1.7 MB (compressed custom format) |
| Restore start | 2026-07-30T20:11:42Z |
| Restore complete | 2026-07-30T20:11:46Z |
| Restore duration | ~4 seconds |
| Scratch target | `frostgate-restore-proof-20260730` (local Docker, isolated) |
| Row-count result | PASS — all tables match exactly |
| ENG-RESTORE-PROOF-01 | PASS — engagement, findings, audit_events, scan_results all match |
| Runbook | `docs/operators/backup_restore.md` |
| Evidence manifest | `docs/governance/status/L04_evidence_manifest.md` |
| Secrets committed | None |
| Production modified | None |

**Plan upgrade note:** Railway Pro is required for automatic backups (`maxBackupsCount > 0`). T5 infra headroom task should include the plan upgrade decision. Until then, pre-engagement manual `pg_dump` is the production backup strategy (see `docs/operators/backup_restore.md` §5 and `first_client_prep.md`).

**Roadmap Drift:** T1 complete on Day 1 as planned. No drift.

**Repository Health:** Working tree clean on main before branching. `docs/operators/backup_restore.md` and `docs/governance/status/L04_evidence_manifest.md` added.

**Open Risks:**
- FG-LR-001, FG-LR-002, FG-LR-004, FG-LR-005 remain open — no durable evidence yet.
- Railway hobby plan confirmed with no automatic backups; manual `pg_dump` is the current backup path; upgrade decision deferred to T5.
- `CLIENT_READINESS.md` is stale relative to the named-user portal cutover.
- `credential_delivery.md` still needs the T14 named-user rewrite.

**Recommended Next Action:** Execute T2 (Anthropic auto-recharge) and T3 (secret rotation) before touching production config further. T4 portal named-user proof is the next P0 blocker after that.

**Execution Notes:** The frozen audit is the source of truth. T1 is the only change in this PR. No product surface, trust-layer, or architecture changes.

## Execution History (recent, newest first)

### 2026-07-30 — Executive Delivery Review + T1.5 Merge

**Review Type:** Daily Execution Review

**Summary:** T1.5 merged to main via PR #598 (5f5d4a17). Ring_state_dir Dockerfile fix merged via PR #595 (48f1d30b). Six bot review findings on `fg_backup.sh` corrected in the same PR cycle: retention bucket graduation by age range, offsite_uploaded 3-state exit truth, restore validates against manifest `source_row_counts` not live production, manifest uploaded after verification, encrypted archive discovery via find with `.dump.enc`, backup ID sequence from max manifest scan. Script expanded from 7 to 10 subcommands: added `verify-manifest`, `inventory`, `metrics`. Added HMAC-SHA256 signed manifests, immutable backup IDs (FG-BKP-YYYYMMDD-NNNNN), dry-run mode, backup health dashboard, Prometheus metrics text output. 73 hermetic pytest tests; CI green (all 496 tests pass, fmt-check clean, PR_FIX_LOG entries P-35/P-36/P-37 added).

**Major Changes:**
- `scripts/backup/fg_backup.sh` — 10-subcommand backup CLI (final merged version)
- `scripts/backup/backup_config.sh`, `providers/upload_base.sh`, `providers/upload_local.sh`, `providers/upload_s3_compatible.sh` — provider layer with 3-state exit protocol
- `tests/backup/` — 9 test files, 73 tests covering all subcommands
- `docs/operators/backup_automation.md`, `disaster_recovery.md`, `backup_schedule.md`
- `Dockerfile` — `/app/state` and `/app/models` now created in image (ring_state_dir crash fixed)
- `docs/ai/PR_FIX_LOG.md` — entries P-35, P-36, P-37 added

**Decisions Made:**
- Backup IDs use max-sequence scan of existing manifests (not file count) to survive pruning.
- Restore validation uses `source_row_counts` captured at backup time (not live prod) to avoid false mismatches.
- Provider skip exits 2 (not 0) so callers can distinguish success / failure / skip without touching `offsite_uploaded`.
- Retention bucketing uses age ranges (not global sort position) so each bucket's count is enforced independently.

**Blockers discovered:** None new. FG-LR-001/002/004/005 remain open.

**Updated Launch Confidence:** 68%

**Next:** T2 (Anthropic auto-recharge, 0.1d) and T3 (top-5 secret rotation, 0.5d) are the immediate work order. T4 (portal named-user proof, 2.0d) follows.

## T1.5 Execution History

**Date:** 2026-07-30
**Task:** T1.5 Backup Automation & Recovery Hardening
**Status:** COMPLETE

**Summary:** Built the automation layer on top of the T1 proven method. Added `scripts/backup/fg_backup.sh` (production-grade bash) with subcommands `backup / verify / restore / list / prune / drill / status`. Wraps the T1 `pgvector/pgvector:pg18` `pg_dump` recipe verbatim — no change to the proven method itself. Adds SHA-256 manifest per backup, optional AES-256-CBC (pbkdf2 iter=600k) encryption with fail-closed key check, pluggable offsite provider (local / S3 / R2 / B2, all sourced from `scripts/backup/providers/*.sh`), configurable retention with 5 age buckets and a hard "never delete the single newest successful backup" invariant, monthly restore drill that appends evidence to `docs/governance/status/restore_drill_evidence_YYYYMMDD.md`, and a `status` JSON report with RPO/RTO warning thresholds.

**Files added:**
- `scripts/backup/fg_backup.sh` — main script (chmod +x, bash -n clean)
- `scripts/backup/backup_config.sh` — env-driven config with defaults
- `scripts/backup/providers/upload_base.sh` — provider interface
- `scripts/backup/providers/upload_local.sh` — local filesystem provider
- `scripts/backup/providers/upload_s3_compatible.sh` — S3/R2/B2 stub (rclone or aws-cli)
- `docs/operators/backup_automation.md` — automation architecture, config, workflow, failure handling, key rotation, offsite setup
- `docs/operators/disaster_recovery.md` — RTO/RPO targets, full DR procedure, escalation, comms template
- `docs/operators/backup_schedule.md` — one-page schedule reference card
- `tests/backup/conftest.py`, `test_backup_manifest.py`, `test_backup_config.py`, `test_backup_checksum.py`, `test_retention.py`, `test_backup_shell.py`

**Files modified:**
- `docs/operators/backup_restore.md` — added §14 cross-ref to automation docs; updated §13 with T1.5 note
- `docs/operators/first_client_prep.md` — §0 now references `fg_backup.sh backup --type pre-engagement`
- `docs/governance/status/EXECUTION_STATE.md` — this file

**Not changed:**
- The T1 proven method in `docs/operators/backup_restore.md` §1–§13 is unchanged.
- `docs/governance/status/L04_evidence_manifest.md` — frozen evidence, untouched.
- No CI, deployment, auth, or schema files touched.

**Decisions:**
- Full logical dumps only, no true incrementals. Rationale documented in `backup_automation.md §2`: Railway Hobby exposes no WAL/basebackup access; DB is 1.7 MB; incrementals would add complexity with zero benefit at this scale.
- Newest-backup protection is a hard invariant in the pruner (unit-tested) so retention math can never orphan the last recovery point.
- S3 provider intentionally exits 0 with "skipped: credentials not configured" when creds are absent — scheduled backups do not fail because offsite is still being wired up; the manifest records `offsite_uploaded: false` for monitoring.
- `verify` uses `pg_restore --list` where docker is available; on encrypted archives it skips that check (they must be decrypted first) but still verifies SHA-256.

**Launch Confidence:** 65% -> 67%.

**Next:** T2 (Anthropic auto-recharge) and T3 (secret rotation).

## Execution History

### 2026-07-30 — T1 Backup and Restore Proof

**Review Type:** Task Execution

**Summary:** T1 executed fully. Railway plan tier confirmed as hobby (no automatic backups). Production database dumped via `pg_dump` using `pgvector/pgvector:pg18` Docker image (required for PostgreSQL 18.4 server compatibility). Dump restored into isolated local Docker scratch container `frostgate-restore-proof-20260730`. All row counts matched between production and restored database. L4 marked PASS. FG-LR-003 closed.

**Major Changes:**
- Created `docs/operators/backup_restore.md` (operator runbook).
- Created `docs/governance/status/L04_evidence_manifest.md` (sanitized evidence manifest).
- Updated `docs/governance/status/EXECUTION_STATE.md` (this file).

**Completed Tasks:**
- Railway plan tier verified: hobby. `subscriptionPlanLimit.volumes.maxBackupsCount = 0` — no automatic backups.
- Production DB: PostgreSQL 18.4, migration 0168, 372 tables, 7 engagements, 59 findings.
- pg_dump completed: 1.7 MB compressed custom format. Duration: ~2 minutes (including Docker pull and network).
- Scratch container `frostgate-restore-proof-20260730` created: `pgvector/pgvector:pg18` (isolation confirmed).
- Restore: exit code 0. Duration: ~4 seconds.
- Validation: all counts match. ENG-RESTORE-PROOF-01 (June 2026 dry-run engagement): 1/22/0/28/12 — PASS.
- No production writes. No production service pointed at scratch.
- No credentials or dump files committed.
- `make fg-fast` will be run before PR submission.

**Blockers discovered:**
- pg_dump v16 refuses to dump PostgreSQL v18 server. Resolved: use `pgvector/pgvector:pg18` Docker image (pg_dump 18.4).
- Standard `postgres:18` lacks pgvector extension. Resolved: use `pgvector/pgvector:pg18` image for both scratch and pg_restore.
- Railway Hobby plan confirmed to have zero automatic backups. Documented in runbook; upgrade decision deferred to T5.

**New Risks:** None in T1 scope. Railway hobby plan backup gap is documented and a mitigation (pre-engagement `pg_dump`) is in place. T5 will decide on Railway Pro upgrade.

**Decisions Made:** Use `pgvector/pgvector:pg18` as the canonical restore image (matches production schema including vector extension). Evidence manifest placed in `docs/governance/status/` (tracked) rather than `artifacts/launch_evidence/` (git-ignored) to avoid `.gitignore` modification.

**Updated Launch Confidence:** 65%

### 2026-07-30 — Initial State (pre-T1)

**Review Type:** Daily Execution Review

**Summary:** Initial execution review after the Launch Readiness Audit was frozen. Repository is on PR #592, which is CI/tooling work and not a launch-plan task. The launch plan remains intact: recovery proof first, then final secrets/auth proof, then full dry run.

**Major Changes:** Created canonical `docs/governance/status/EXECUTION_STATE.md`. Recorded current branch, commit, PR, CI state, blockers, critical path, and launch confidence.

**Completed Tasks:** Frozen Launch Readiness Audit PR #593 merged. Local focused verification passed for platform authority, service principal, portal user authority, and portal tenant registry tests.

**New Risks:** Current active PR #592 may distract from T1 if treated as launch-critical. CI for PR #592 is still pending.

**Decisions Made:** Today's highest-ROI work is T1 backup/restore proof as the primary objective, with T2 Anthropic auto-recharge as the secondary objective if T1 is not blocked. PR #592 should be monitored or merged only if checks pass without consuming launch execution time.

**Updated Launch Confidence:** 60%


Ring State Directory

Status: RESOLVED

Resolution:
- PR #595 deployed successfully.
- Container starts successfully.
- Application startup completed.
- No ring_state_dir errors observed.
- No restart loop detected.
- Repeated /health probes returned HTTP 200.

Production Evidence:
- Docker image creates:
  - /app/state
  - /app/models
  - /var/lib/frostgate/state
- Uvicorn reached "Application startup complete."
- Continuous health checks succeeded after deployment.

Launch Impact:
- Operational blocker cleared.
- This is no longer considered a Launch DoD blocker.

Follow-up (Configuration Hygiene):
Confirm the canonical production value for FG_RING_STATE_DIR.

Preferred:
    /var/lib/frostgate/state

Temporary compatibility:
    /app/state

Until documentation is updated, either path is operational because PR #595 creates both directories during image build.
