# SOC Enforceable Findings Matrix (Release Authority)

This matrix defines **hard release invariants**.  
All gates are binary pass/fail. No warnings. No release exceptions.

## Findings Matrix

| Finding ID | Invariant | Enforcement Mechanism | CI Gate | Release Blocker |
|------------|-----------|-----------------------|---------|------------------|
| SOC-P0-001 | `FG_AUTH_ALLOW_FALLBACK` must be `false` in prod/staging runtime invariants. | Runtime invariant + prod profile validation. | `make soc-invariants`, `make prod-profile-check` | Y |
| SOC-P0-002 | Fail-open controls (`FG_RL_FAIL_OPEN`, `FG_AUTH_DB_FAIL_OPEN`) must be `false` in prod/staging. | Runtime invariant + hardening tests. | `make soc-invariants`, `make test-auth-hardening` | Y |
| SOC-P0-003 | `/decisions`, `/feed/live`, `/feed/stream` must deny unscoped or cross-tenant reads. | Integration tests (tenant isolation suites). | `make test-tenant-isolation` | Y |
| SOC-P0-004 | Governance endpoints must require authentication and fail closed on DB errors. | Integration tests + startup validation. | `make test-auth-hardening` | Y |
| SOC-P0-005 | `FG_ENFORCEMENT_MODE` must be `enforce` in prod/staging. | Runtime invariant + enforcement matrix test. | `make enforcement-mode-matrix` | Y |
| SOC-P0-006 | Tripwire egress policy must block disallowed webhook destinations. | Security regression tests. | `make security-regression-gates` | Y |
| SOC-P0-007 | Admin redirect and CORS must reject unsafe production values. | Admin startup validation + integration tests. | `make ci-admin` | Y |
| SOC-P1-001 | Route inventory drift is blocked unless snapshot is intentionally regenerated. | AST route extraction + snapshot diff. | `make route-inventory-audit` | Y |
| SOC-P1-002 | Fallback module imports in runtime API are prohibited. | Static invariant scan. | `make soc-invariants` | Y |
| SOC-P1-003 | Redirect-following HTTP clients are restricted to approved wrappers/files. | Static invariant scan. | `make soc-invariants` | Y |
| SOC-HIGH-001 | Protected security/invariant test suites cannot contain vacuous assertions without explicit suppression. | Static test-quality scan with enforced suppression rules. | `make test-quality-gate` | Y |
| SOC-HIGH-002 | Security-critical file changes require SOC review documentation updates. | Diff-aware SOC sync verification. | `make soc-review-sync` | Y |

# MVP2 Stage Gate Definition

MVP2 is achieved only when ALL gates pass:

- [ ] `make soc-invariants`
- [ ] `make prod-profile-check`
- [ ] `make enforcement-mode-matrix`
- [ ] `make security-regression-gates`
- [ ] `make test-tenant-isolation`
- [ ] `make ci-admin`
- [ ] `make route-inventory-audit`
- [ ] `make test-quality-gate`
- [ ] `make soc-review-sync`
- [ ] `make soc-manifest-verify`

## Gate Semantics

- Binary pass/fail only.
- Zero suppressed P0 violations.
- Zero unresolved HIGH findings.
- No exceptions in release branches.
- Every matrix entry maps to at least one enforced CI gate.

# CI Wiring Architecture

## Guard Scripts

- `tools/ci/check_soc_invariants.py`
- `tools/ci/check_enforcement_mode_matrix.py`
- `tools/ci/check_route_inventory.py`
- `tools/ci/check_test_quality.py`
- `tools/ci/check_soc_review_sync.py`
- `tools/ci/sync_soc_manifest_status.py`

### SOC Review Sync Behavior

`check_soc_review_sync.py`:

- Computes diff against merge-base (`origin/${GITHUB_BASE_REF}...HEAD`)
- Deepens shallow clones in CI when necessary
- Fails closed if diff cannot be computed
- Blocks changes to security-critical paths unless SOC docs are updated

---

# Makefile Targets

- `soc-invariants`
- `enforcement-mode-matrix`
- `route-inventory-generate`
- `route-inventory-audit`
- `test-quality-gate`
- `soc-review-sync`
- `soc-manifest-verify`
- `soc-manifest-sync`

---

# Workflow Wiring

- `fg-fast` → developer enforcement lane
- `fg-fast-full` / `fg-fast-ci` → extended CI lane
- `soc-manifest-verify` is part of `fg-fast`
- `soc-manifest-sync` is manual only

---

# Warning → Hard-Fail Promotions

The following are hard failures:

- Observe mode in prod/staging
- Route inventory drift
- Vacuous assertions in protected suites
- Missing SOC doc updates for critical file changes
- Unresolved P0 findings in manifest
- Missing evidence linkage for mitigated findings

---

# Regression Immunity Architecture

## 1. Route Inventory Audit

Snapshot file: `tools/ci/route_inventory.json`

Inventory fields:

- `method`
- `path`
- `file`
- `scoped`
- `scopes`
- `tenant_bound`

Allowed values for `scoped` and `tenant_bound`:

- `true`
- `false`
- `"unknown"`

### Gate Behavior

FAIL if:

- Any regression (`true → false`)
- Any `"unknown"` remains
- Snapshot drift without intentional regeneration

Remediation:

```
make route-inventory-generate
git add tools/ci/route_inventory.json
```

---

## 2. Fallback Import Detection

`check_soc_invariants.py` blocks `import ...fallback...` patterns under:

- `api/**`
- `admin_gateway/**`

Excluded paths:

- `.venv`
- `site-packages`
- `__pycache__`
- `.pytest_cache`
- `.mypy_cache`
- `node_modules`
- `dist`
- `build`

SOC invariants apply only to first-party code.

---

## 3. Redirect-Following Client Restrictions

Redirect-following HTTP clients are allowed only in explicitly approved wrappers/files.  
All other occurrences are hard-fail.

---

## 4. Observe-Mode Runtime Lock

`api/config/prod_invariants.py` enforces:

- `FG_ENFORCEMENT_MODE=enforce` in prod/staging.

Matrix tests validate both pass and fail branches.

---

## 5. Protected Test Quality Enforcement

Protected suites:

- `tests/security/**`
- `tests/**/test_*invariant*.py`

Vacuous assertions require explicit suppression marker:

```
# SOC:ALLOW_VACUOUS_ASSERT reason="..." remove_by="YYYY-MM-DD"
```

Rules:

- `reason` must be non-empty.
- `remove_by` must be valid date and not expired.
- Total suppressions ≤ 10 in CI.
- `FG_TEST_QUALITY_SUPPRESSION_CAP` allowed locally only (ignored when `CI=true`).
- TODO-based skip markers are forbidden.

---

# SOC Manifest Governance

Manifest file:

`tools/ci/soc_findings_manifest.json`

Allowed status values:

- `open`
- `partial`
- `mitigated`

Mitigated findings must:

- Include `evidence`
- Reference existing file paths
- Link to at least one:
  - `tests/**`
  - `tools/ci/**`
  - Gate-enforced file

`sync_soc_manifest_status.py` enforces:

- Schema validity
- Required P0 coverage
- Gate presence
- Evidence existence
- Deterministic atomic writes

---

# Mainline Rebase Hygiene

If SOC docs appear as newly added unexpectedly in a PR:

```
make rebase-main-instructions
```

Rebase locally against `origin/main` before re-running SOC gates.

---

# Local Usage

```
make soc-manifest-verify
make soc-manifest-sync
make fg-fast
make fg-fast-full
```

Direct invocation:

```
PYTHONPATH=. .venv/bin/python tools/ci/sync_soc_manifest_status.py --mode verify --fail-on-unresolved-p0
PYTHONPATH=. .venv/bin/python tools/ci/sync_soc_manifest_status.py --mode sync --write
```
